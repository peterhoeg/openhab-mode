* openhab-modes

This is a collection of major modes for working with various [[https://openhab.org][openHAB]] files.

The primary objective is to get syntax highlighting and indentation working
(both as-you-write and formatting of the entire buffer) and while *far* from
complete, it's absolutely useable for rules files now.

Support for =.items= and =.things= files will probably come last as I don't
write those by hand anyway - they are all generated.

Modes:
- [[xbase-mode]]
- [[openhab-item-mode]]
- [[openhab-rule-mode]]
- [[openhab-sitemap-mode]]
- [[openhab-thing-mode]]

* xbase-mode

=rules= files are based on [[https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/][Xtend]], so included here is =xtend-mode.el= which is
used as the mode from which =openhab-rules-mode= derives.

* openhab-item-mode

Not implemented yet.

* openhab-rule-mode

The basic mode for editing =.rules= files.

* openhab-sitemap-mode

Not implemented yet.

* openhab-thing-mode
